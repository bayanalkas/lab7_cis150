# File Copy Utility

The File Copy Utility is a simple C++ program that copies the contents of one file to another. In this example, it copies the contents of "input.txt" to "alkas.txt."

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   g++ CopyFile.cpp -o copy_file

## Files
CopyFile.cpp: The main C++ source code file.
input.txt: The input file to be copied.
alkas.txt: The output file where the contents will be copied.

## How It Works
The program uses file streams to read from "input.txt" and write to "alkas.txt." It reads each line from the input file and writes it to the output file until the end of the input file is reached.
